### Project Title
Explore US bikeshare data

### Description
The project produces statistics, using bike-sharing data from Chicago, New York
City, and Washington DC.  The calculated statistics include the most popular
month, day of the week and hour of the day.  The program also provides
information about the most popular start and end stations, as well as the most
popular route. The total and average time of all trips is also calculated.
If data is available, the program also counts the different types of users,
their gender, and finds the earliest and latest of their birth year.

The program provides the opportunity to the user to filter the data by city,
month, and day of the week.
